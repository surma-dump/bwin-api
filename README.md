# bwin-api

`bwin-api` is a endeavor to give [bwin](http://bwin.de) some kind of API.

Although I didn't find anything, this is probably against bwin's [EULA](https://help.bwin.com/General/Legal/general_tac_overview.aspx?sc_lang=de) or something, so you are probably not allowed to use it. I have never used it my self.

Actual documentation will follow
